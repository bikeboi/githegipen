#+title: Foregoing The Real

* Draft #1
There's a strange moment felt by people in my generation--perhaps felt by a few, one or
two generations back--where a lived experience feels less real, almost false,
when it doesn't fit into one of our preconceived idea of what that experience
should be. Perhaps this happens and has happened to all human beings, to some
extent; perhaps it's only a question of degree: this phenomenon is common and
extreme in our age, where mimesis can be done on such a granular level, films
and photography able to paint more vividly than ever before, implanting our
minds so strongly with dreams of reality that, when we finally meet the thing
itself it seems a farce. Of course, what is actually happen is far from
mimesis, the representation of reality: it is that of /hyperreality/.
