# Blog (?)

The word blog is a shortening of 'weblog', which itself is a portmanteau of web and log. Web-log. Such a cold and machine-like way of describing writing on the internet. Why has it stuck? Maybe because it's one syllable. Or maybe it evokes the same puerile internal snickering -- the kind that doesn't leave until well into your 70s, and even then maybe not -- as the word 'blob', or 'glob'.

Anyway, this is where I write more technical articles/essays. Enjoy.
